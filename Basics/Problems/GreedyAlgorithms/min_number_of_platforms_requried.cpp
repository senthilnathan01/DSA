/*
Given arrival arr[] and departure dep[] times of trains on the same day, find the minimum number of platforms needed so that no train waits. 
A platform cannot serve two trains at the same time; if a train arrives before another departs, an extra platform is needed.

Note: Time intervals are in the 24-hour format (HHMM) , where the first two characters represent hour (between 00 to 23 ) and 
the last two characters represent minutes (this will be <= 59 and >= 0). Leading zeros for hours less than 10 are optional (e.g., 0900 is the same as 900).
