/*
Given a weighted and directed graph of v vertices and edges, Find the shortest 
distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex, src and return a list of 
integers where the ith integer denotes the distance of the ith node from the 
source node. If a vertices can't be reach from the s then mark the distance as 10^8.
Note: If there exist a path to a negative weighted cycle from the source node then return {-1}.
